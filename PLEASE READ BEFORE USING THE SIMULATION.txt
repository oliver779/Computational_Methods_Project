Hi!
This is a short Instructions manual!

The User should put the 3 files + the two reference Data files into the same folder

Open the main.py file to run the code.

Fill out all of the input fields within the GUI that will pop up. (If not needed, leave them as zero (0)).

Press the Run Simulation button and wait for the simulation to finish. A statement will come up at the end
showing how long the simulation has been running in real time, wait for that please.

If the user wants to run the simulation again, or with different values, run the main.py file again.

Additional help:

 - Feel free to open all the other files to see how the code was written.

 - If the Run Simulation button does not work, try pressing on a different input value with your mouse
   and press  the Run Simulation button again. It should work.

That is all!
Have Fun!
